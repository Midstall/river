# A NixOS system for a River SoC that boots from an SD card through Weir.
#
# Weir is the platform UEFI firmware: it looks for a GPT ESP and loads
# \EFI\BOOT\BOOTRISCV64.EFI. We put systemd-boot there, which then boots NixOS
# (kernel + initrd + loader entry off the same ESP), and the initrd mounts the
# ext4 root from the SD (harbor_spi + mmc_spi).
#
# The image comes from the NixOS `image.repart` module: build-host systemd-repart
# under fakeroot assembles a GPT image with no VM and no target execution, so it
# cross-compiles to riscv64 from an x86_64/aarch64 host with no qemu/binfmt. GPT
# matters here - Weir does gpt.findEsp() and, failing that, reads the WHOLE disk
# at LBA 0 as one FAT. It never scans MBR partitions, so the MBR layout from
# sd-image.nix would be invisible to it.
#
# The flake sets hardware.river.ipPackage, nixpkgs.hostPlatform (riscv64-linux)
# and nixpkgs.buildPlatform (the build host, for cross).
